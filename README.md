#  Expense Tracker App
The Expense Tracker App is a simple web application that allows users to track their expenses. 
This app does not require a backend server to store data; instead, it utilizes the browser's local storage to save and retrieve transaction data.

## Features
Add transactions: Users can add transactions by providing a description and the transaction amount. Positive amounts represent income, while negative amounts represent expenses.

View transaction history: The app displays a list of all transactions entered by the user, showing the description, amount, and type (income or expense).

Balance calculation: The app calculates and displays the current balance based on the entered transactions.

## Technologies Used:
The Expense Tracker App is built using the following technologies:

HTML: Markup language used to structure the app's user interface.

CSS: Style sheet language used for visual styling and layout.

JavaScript: Programming language used for implementing the app's logic and interactivity.

## Usage:
To use the Expense Tracker App, follow these steps:

Clone the repository or download the source code files to your local machine.

Open the index.html file in a web browser.

The app will load, and you will see the user interface with an input form for adding transactions.

Enter a brief description of the transaction in the "Description" field.

Enter the transaction amount in the "Amount" field. Use positive values for income and negative values for expenses.

Click the "Add Transaction" button to add the transaction to the list.

The app will update the transaction list, balance, and summary values automatically.

To view the transaction history, scroll down the page to see the list of transactions with their descriptions and amounts.

You can add more transactions by repeating steps 4 to 7.

To remove a transaction from the list, click the "x" button next to the transaction.

The app will save the entered transactions in the browser's local storage. Closing the app and reopening it will retain the transaction history.

## Limitations
The Expense Tracker App relies on the browser's local storage to store transaction data. Clearing the browser's cache or using a different browser/device may result in data loss.

As the app does not have a backend server, it cannot sync data across multiple devices or provide data backup and recovery options.

## Future Enhancements
The Expense Tracker App can be enhanced in the following ways:

Implement user authentication: Add user authentication to allow multiple users to track their own expenses securely.

Data backup and sync: Integrate a cloud-based storage solution or backend server to enable data backup and sync across devices.

Categorize transactions: Provide options for users to categorize transactions (e.g., groceries, utilities, entertainment) for better expense analysis.

Reporting and insights: Generate reports and provide insights on spending patterns, monthly summaries, and expense trends.

Responsive design: Make the app responsive to support various screen sizes and devices.
